		<h2>Banja Koviljaca</h2>
		<p>
			Banja Koviljaca is famous for its healing thermal mineral springs where Romans were the first to create a bath for.
			It was again rebuilt in the 17th century by the Turks during the Ottoman Empire.
			The first chemical analysis of the water was performed in 1855 after which the first guest house was built. It was soon after protected by the state and expanded during the reigns of the Obrenovic dynasty and Karadjordjevic after them.
			Part of the spa complex is our wedding venue “Kur-Salon” which was built by the king Aleksandar I Karadjordjevic in 1932, who was heavily inspired by similar “Kur-Salon” buildings in Vienna of that time.
			Kur-Salon was a popular place for festivities organized by the noble class in forms of balls and galas. It was also the first gambling hole in the entire Balkans. It was so popular that musicians paid to play there.
			After the collapse of Yugoslavia, Kur-Salon was not maintained and soon became a ruin.
			Finally, it was reinstated to its previous glory in 2016. And since then it has become a popular events venue and restaurant with live traditional music and superb food.
			The Banja’s spa complex today consists of a big park with a fountain in the middle, surrounded by several rehabilitation centers, wellness hotels and the above mentioned “Kur-Salon”.
			We hope you will enjoy this place as much as we enjoy it every time we are in Serbia.
