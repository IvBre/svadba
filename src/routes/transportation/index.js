		<h1>Transportation</h1>
		<p>
			Coming from outside of Serbia is best to come with the airplane to Belgrade.
			There is also an airport in Tuzla in Bosnia, but due to travel restrictions in Bosnia it could produce problems for you on the border. Please check the latest regulations here.
			We recommend spending 2-3 days in Belgrade if you haven’t been there before. The city is famous for its history and fortress in the city center but also for its very vivid nightlife.
			More information on things to do in Belgrade here.
			From Belgrade to Banja Koviljaca you can take the bus from the main bus station in Belgrade city center.
			Usually there is a bus every hour that goes to Loznica, from which you can take a taxi to Banja.
			You can also take the direct bus to Banja, but check for the schedule beforehands here:
			Besides the bus you can also take the train. The train goes once per day so it might be tricky to arrange yourself,
			but the ride is very enjoyable since not so many people use it. The main train station in Belgrade is moved to “Prokop”
			which is not in the city center so you would need to take a taxi and calculate some extra time to get there.
			You can check the train timetable here:
			You can also rent a car in Belgrade and drive to Banja. This is specifically recommended because there will be one part of the wedding ceremony where you would need a car.
			Check the “Tradition” page for more details on that.
			Take a look and car rentals here:


			Important warning #1! Once you land at the airport, never in any circumstances take a taxi from people who are asking you if you need a taxi.
			There are a lot of fake taxi drivers that will try to rip you off. So once you leave the gate you will see a booth next to the exit from the airport building where it says something like “taxi vouchers”.
			You need to go there and tell them where you need to go and they will give you a voucher on which the real price is written.
			You will then go outside of the building and look for the line of taxi vehicles on the left.
			The taxi driver will ask you for the voucher to show it. Only enter in vehicles asking for this voucher.
			No matter what the taxi driver says, you are obliged only to pay the amount written on this voucher, no more.

			Important warning #2! Never enter in a taxi on the street. Always call the taxi service instead.
			There are a lot of wild fake taxis that will try to rip you off especially when they realize you are a foreigner.
			The numbers of taxi call centers can be found here:
			You can also use the “car::go” service which is like a Serbian Uber. Download the app here:
